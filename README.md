# ggplot2_beginner_intro_EM5042
The introduction of ggplot2 using the data from real-world industry process control.

### ----- Briefly explain what those data are -----

## Several datasets used here

#### mpg data 
    data set provided in R, all about cars

#### Jellybeans.dat
    This data includes the weight of jellybeans from different samples and trays

#### Earing.dat
    Earing measurements from different lots

#### Height.dat
    Height measurement for 10 parts from different operators, repeated measure for 2 times.

#### Some vis from another dataset
    Segment analysis for some famous cycling routes around Boulder
    complete time and power output by different cyclists.

## ggplot2 Introduction

ggplot2 is an open-source data visualization package for the statistical programming language R. Created by Hadley Wickham in 2005, ggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson's Grammar of Graphicsâ€”a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers. ggplot2 can serve as a replacement for the base graphics in R and contains a number of defaults for web and print display of common scales. Since 2005, ggplot2 has grown in use to become one of the most popular R packages. It's also the foundation of many graphic applications such as Vega-Lite and Tableau.

This RMD file provides some basic application of ggplot2 and you should be able to create similar plots as I did in the pdf/powerpoint file as long as you use the same dataset and type-along with the code.
